  enumerated possible values: True,False
  Description: Broadcast surveyed base station position.
  Notes: This flag ultimately determines whether the SBP message with identifier
    MSG_BASE_POS_ECEF will be calculated and sent. Logically, setting this attribute to
    "true" sets the Local receiver as a base station and configures the unit to send
    its surveyed position coordinates to the other receiver(s) with which the base
    station is communicating. If "true", the remote receiver that receives the
    surveyed position will calculate and communicate a pseudo absolute
    RTK position based upon the received position.
